# Frontend UI Design - CPE19 Project

This project was undertaken as part of the CPE19: Emerging Technologies in CPE course. Initially, I approached this project with some apprehension due to my unfamiliarity with CSS. While I initially preferred drag-and-drop web building tools, I gradually gained a deeper understanding of CSS and its role in styling web pages. 

## Key Learnings

* **HTML & CSS Fundamentals:** I acquired foundational knowledge in HTML and CSS, the core languages for building web page structure and presentation.
* **JavaScript Fundamentals:** I implemented basic JavaScript functionalities, such as handling the Carousel effect, gaining initial experience with client-side scripting.
* **UI/UX Principles:** I explored visual design techniques like parallax scrolling and implemented a Carousel component, enhancing the website's visual appeal and user interaction.
* **API Integration:** I experimented with API integration for displaying YouTube videos before opting for a more straightforward embedded link approach.
* **Responsive Design & Frameworks:** I recognized the importance of responsive design and the potential benefits of utilizing front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) to streamline development and improve maintainability.

## Reflections

This project challenged me to step outside my comfort zone and embrace a more manual approach to web development. While the final outcome may not be perfect, it provided valuable insights into the intricacies of web design and development. I understand the importance of clean, responsive design and plan to further explore front-end frameworks and best practices in future projects.
